# Third-party notices

OakScript uses these pinned packages and their transitive dependencies. Their copyright and license notices are distributed in `third-party-licenses/` beside this file.

`LICENSE.txt` applies to the owner's original OakScript implementation and executable only to the extent of rights the owner controls. It does not replace or narrow the independent licenses and permissions of the third-party components listed below or the included font. Redistribution rights granted by those licenses remain in force for those components.

The optional native compiler invokes an installed MinGW-w64 GCC toolchain; the
toolchain itself is not bundled. The included `native-math.exe` was built with
GCC 15.2.0 and statically links these native runtime components:

- GCC `libgcc` and GNU `libstdc++`: Free Software Foundation and contributors,
  GPL-3.0-or-later with GCC Runtime Library Exception 3.1. The license, exception,
  and installed package's license summary are in `third-party-licenses/GCC-runtime-*`.
  [Official runtime license](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/libstdc++/manual/license.html).
- MinGW-w64 runtime: MinGW-w64 contributors; Zope Public License 2.1, public-domain
  and other notices reproduced in `third-party-licenses/MinGW-w64-*`.
- MinGW-w64 winpthreads: MinGW-w64 contributors; its MIT/BSD notices are reproduced
  unchanged in `third-party-licenses/winpthreads-COPYING.txt`.

Native programs built using another toolchain use that toolchain's own runtime
components and notices. The ordinary runner does not link these GCC libraries.

The example models, checker texture, Acorn Run scenery, Oak Blocks textures, and example WAV sounds are generated within this project. Acorn Run and Oak Blocks include the unchanged Atkinson Hyperlegible font, copyright 2020 Braille Institute of America, Inc., under SIL Open Font License 1.1. Its full license is distributed with each game's font as `assets/OFL.txt`.

Native graphics also compiles stb_truetype, stb_image and stb_image_write from nothings/stb,
pinned at 2c980bb59875b0d32144a71867fbdebb2f77cd20. These native headers retain
their MIT/Public Domain alternatives; complete license text is in
`third-party-licenses/stb-native-LICENSE.txt`. Source: https://github.com/nothings/stb

Native SPIR-V shader translation uses SPIRV-Cross (Khronos Group and contributors),
pinned at aa217aeb6c9f0ace7a0ab233b28807edf45eb165, under Apache License 2.0.

`third-party-licenses/SPIRV-Cross-Apache-2.0.txt` and the vendored source headers.

This translates GPU shader binaries; it does not execute Oak programs.

Native glTF/GLB model loading uses nlohmann/json (Niels Lohmann and contributors),
pinned at 23d3b373e1a41db5adde1081b409e66de1d65030, under the MIT License.
The full license is in `third-party-licenses/nlohmann-json-MIT.txt`.
